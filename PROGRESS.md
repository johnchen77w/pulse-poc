# Pulse App - Complete Progress Summary

**Last Updated:** October 16, 2025

## Project Overview

**Pulse** is a Flutter mobile app for seniors (65+) to perform daily emotional check-ins, receive AI-generated summaries, and optionally share weekly updates with family members. Currently in POC stage.

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Project Initialization & Structure

- Created complete Flutter project structure with all platform support
- Set up proper `.gitignore` following Flutter best practices
- Git repository initialized and synced to GitHub (`johnchen77w/pulse-poc`)
- Created asset folders (`assets/images/`, `assets/icons/`)

### 2. Core Application Files

**Files Created:**
- `lib/main.dart` - App entry point with Supabase initialization
- `lib/app.dart` - MaterialApp with routing configuration
- `pubspec.yaml` - Dependencies and asset registration

### 3. Screen Implementation

**Authentication Screens:**
- `lib/screens/auth/login_screen.dart` - Login with email/password
- `lib/screens/auth/register_screen.dart` - Registration with name, email, password, age

**Main App Screens:**
- `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` - Dashboard with "Start Daily Check-in" button
- `lib/screens/question_screen.dart` - Daily emotional reflection input
- `lib/screens/summary_screen.dart` - AI-generated summaries display
- `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` - User settings/preferences

**UI Features:**
- Senior-friendly large fonts (18-20pt)
- High-contrast, readable text
- Simple, uncluttered layouts
- All screens have placeholder UIs with TODO comments

### 4. Navigation System

**Working Navigation Flow:**
```
Login Screen → Home Screen
Register Screen → Home Screen
Home → Daily Check-in (Question Screen)
Question Screen → Submit → Back to Home
Login ↔ Register (bidirectional)
```

**Implementation:**
- Named routes in `app.dart`
- Proper navigation handlers in all buttons
- No dead-end screens

### 5. Supabase Integration

**Core Infrastructure:**
- `lib/services/supabase_client_manager.dart` - Singleton manager for Supabase client
  - Comprehensive usage documentation in code comments
  - Convenience getters for `client` and `auth`
  - Initialized in `main()` before app launch

**Authentication Features:**
- ✅ Real user registration with `signUp()`
- ✅ Real user login with `signInWithPassword()`
- ✅ User metadata storage (name, age) in auth object
- ✅ Form validation (empty fields, valid age)
- ✅ Loading states with CircularProgressIndicator
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly SnackBar messages
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup (TextEditingController disposal)

**Supabase Configuration:**
- Project URL: `https://vusrrkxgpaulflzoimfr.supabase.co`
- Anon key integrated (hardcoded for POC)
- Debug mode enabled for development

**Dependencies Added:**
- `supabase_flutter: ^2.5.0`

## 🎯 Current State

### What Works:

1. ✅ App launches successfully on iOS emulator
2. ✅ Users can register new accounts (saved to Supabase Auth)
3. ✅ Users can login with existing credentials
4. ✅ Navigation between all screens works smoothly
5. ✅ All buttons are functional (no dead clicks)
6. ✅ User data persists in Supabase

### User Flow (End-to-End):

1. Launch app → Login screen appears
2. New users: Register → Fill form → Create account in Supabase → Navigate to Home
3. Existing users: Login → Authenticate → Navigate to Home
4. Home screen → "Start Daily Check-in" → Question screen
5. Question screen → Enter reflection → Submit → Back to Home

## 💡 Technical Notes

### Important Considerations:

- Supabase email confirmation may be enabled by default - disable for easier testing
- User metadata (name, age) is stored in `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data`
- No profiles table yet means user data only exists in Auth
- All screens use StatefulWidget for proper state management
- Following null safety and Flutter best practices

### To Run the App:

```bash
flutter pub get       # Install dependencies
flutter run           # Launch on emulator
```

**Note:** Hot restart (not just hot reload) after `main.dart` changes.
